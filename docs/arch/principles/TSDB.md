# TimescaleDB

A time-series database for high-performance real-time analytics packaged as a Postgres extension

## Optimized for Time-Series Data

The platform is designed to capture and analyze high-frequency data streams from numerous sensors. This is precisely the use case TimescaleDB is built for.

* **High Ingestion Rates**: Industrial environments generate massive amounts of data. TimescaleDB is engineered to handle millions of data points per second, ensuring it can reliably collect the incoming data streams from all DAQ nodes.

* **Hypertables**: This core feature automatically partitions data by time into smaller "chunks". When you query a specific time range, the database only scans the relevant chunks instead of the entire dataset. This makes queries for recent data, which are common in monitoring and real-time visualization, extremely fast.

## Low-Latency Access and Powerful Analytics

The system requires low-latency access for real-time dashboards and control loops. TimescaleDB provides features that accelerate complex queries.

* **Full SQL Support**: Because TimescaleDB is an extension of PostgreSQL, it supports the full SQL query language. This allows for complex queries, joins with other relational data (like equipment metadata or configuration), and the use of a wide range of existing tools and developer skills. This is a major advantage over NoSQL databases that use proprietary query languages.

* **Continuous Aggregates**: This feature automatically and incrementally pre-calculates and stores summary data (e.g., hourly averages, min/max values). When a dashboard requests this summary data, the query is near-instantaneous because the result is already computed, rather than having to process raw data on the fly.

## Efficient Long-Term Data Management

The architecture involves the centralized storage of sensor data for long-term analysis and compliance.

* **Data Compression**: TimescaleDB offers native columnar compression that can reduce storage footprint by over 90%. This significantly lowers the cost of storing years of historical data.

* **Data Lifecycle Management**: It allows for automated data retention policies. For example, you can set rules to automatically delete raw data older than one year or move older, less frequently accessed data to cheaper object storage while still keeping it queryable.

## Reliability and a Mature Ecosystem

By being built on PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB inherits over 25 years of development, making it highly reliable, stable, and secure. This addresses the need for a dependable system for critical industrial applications. It also benefits from the extensive ecosystem of tools, connectors, and community support available for PostgreSQL.
