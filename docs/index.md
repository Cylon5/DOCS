#Background

Industrial and sensor-heavy environments require the capture and analysis of high-frequency, heterogeneous data streams from multiple DAQ nodes. 
These DAQ nodes interface with a wide range of Industrial protocols or low level device drivers such as OPC, Modbus, VISA, DAQMx, MQTT amongst others,
and collect data from devices operating at vastly different sampling ratesâ€”from low-rate environmental sensors to high-rate instruments like high-speed cameras or DAQ systems.

Given the constraints of bandwidth, data variety, and need for resilience in intermittent connectivity environments, DAQ nodes must retain high-resolution data locally using structured file formats such as TDMS. Meanwhile, for centralized visibility, processing, and long-term analysis, the DAQ nodes also stream summarized or transformed data in near real-time using the NATS Core and NATS JetStream messaging technology.

The proposed architecture must enable integration of raw nodes-collected data with centrally stored data to support auditability, diagnostics, compliance, and post-analysis, while also enabling real-time or near-real-time insights from intermediate processing nodes.
Additionally, there is a requirement for real-time visualization of selected data streams to enable human operators and automated systems to react promptly to key metrics, anomalies, or system states.
